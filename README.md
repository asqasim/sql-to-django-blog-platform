# SQL to Django Blog Platform - [ARCHIVED]


**Note:** This project has been archived. I built this to learn database 
concepts but realized Django's ORM abstracted away the SQL I wanted to master.

I've since rebuilt a more comprehensive e-commerce analytics project using 
Flask + raw SQL: https://github.com/asqasim/ecommerce-data-pipeline

This repo remains as a record of my learning process and in Future I may continue this project

A production-style blog platform built step by step, starting with raw SQL and evolving into a Django-based backend.

## Goals
- Learn SQL fundamentals through real schema design
- Integrate SQL with Python
- Build a Django backend using best practices
- Maintain clean Git history and documentation

## Status
Project setup complete. Ready to start SQL development.
